Under graduate thesis titled Multiobjective Fuzzy Modeling and Optimization for High Dimensional Regression Problem
# Description

High-dimensional regression problems come with the curse of dimensionality as the potential number of variables and/or instances turn to be high. The linguistic fuzzy modeling offers a solution of this noble problem but suffers from exponential rule explosion. The first challenge is a large number of rules can be curbed by applying some well-known rule cropping methods. The second challenge is the optimized lateral displacement can be achieved by applying some evolutionary algorithms. However, addressing both challenges leads to a multi-objective optimization problem. This study dedicated to an effective Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that is based on embedded genetic database (DB) learning (variables and fuzzy-partition displacements), provides a fast learning linguistic model that serves as a regression model with higher accuracy for multivariable regression problems. This model converges in a reasonable time that confirms the effectiveness of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm has been tested on the well-known electrical network maintenance cost estimation problem which has four dimensions. This method shows an elegant result on cost estimation
